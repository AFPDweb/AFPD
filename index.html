       The first tall building needs a roof and an interior done. The Tools and Armour
       Shop interiors are not finished.<br/>
       2 new levels have been added ontop of the Mob Farm. A villager breeder has been
       made next to the iron farm to make access of villagers easier. Infact, the breeder
       has already been used as The Libary has started the building process and 4 librarians 
       (villagers with Lecterns) have been moved in.
       </p>
       <p>
       <div style="text-decoration: underline;">28/01/2021:<br/></div>
        The interiors of The Tools and Armour shop have started and soul sand has been
        gathered to create a nether highway using Soul Speed III books, that were
        from a Bastion (in order to get them, lots of death happened). There are 2
        books so far.<br/>
        They also located another Bastion that they may raid in the future.<br/>
        Players MemeACream and PandaPaws24 also built a mob farm. The mob farm
        has 2 levels so far but others can easily be added ontop.
       </p>
       <p>
       <div style="text-decoration: underline;">26/01/2021:<br/></div>
        Planning has taken place and one of the tall buildings have been designed by
        PandaPaws24 and MemeACream. They do not yet know what is going inside.
      </p>
      <p>
      <div style="text-decoration: underline;">19/01/2021:<br/></div>
        Players have worked together to produce 4 new buildings.<br/>
        2 have been completely completed and 2 need interiors done.<br/>
        Players PandaPaws24 and MemeACream have mostly built the buildings.<br/>
        More Players will be thought to join soon.<br/>
        The City started planning around a 1.5 weeks ago and started being built 1 week ago.<br/>
        There is now a total of 4 buildings done.
        The 2 completed buildings are the Fish and Chips Shop and the Bakery.
        The Clothing Shop and the Tools Shop need interiors done before they can open.<br/>
        3 houses have been designed by PandaPaws24 for the players to stay in.</p>
